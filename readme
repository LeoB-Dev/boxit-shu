- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8smiWQ8Seg&t=311s

- Make the nav bar collapsible with animation
Why it doesn't work:

display has no "in-between" state
You can't be "half block" or "75% none"
It's binary: on or off
Browser doesn't know how to animate it

The workaround:
css.sidebar {
  opacity: 0;          /* Invisible but still there */
  visibility: hidden;  /* Don't capture clicks */
  transition: opacity 0.5s, visibility 0.5s;
}

.sidebar.open {
  opacity: 1;
  visibility: visible;
}

Javascript therefore needs to be amended accordingly as all based on flex diplsay proepty.
